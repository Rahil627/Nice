Hello, my name is Graham Misail. I am an aspiring computer scientist interested in web development (frontend and backend),
computer graphics, and artificial intelligence. My primary languages are Haxe and Javascript, however I am fluent and 
experienced in many others, including Lua, Python, Java, C++, C, and C#. I typically use Haxe for cross platform applications and
games using the <i>OpenFL & HaxeFlixel</i> frameworks, while I use Javascript for web development and Node.js development.

<p>
The beginning of these aspirations could be
seen nearly a decade ago. From a young age, I loved <i>creation.</i> You did not need to know me
personally to recognize this; my library of video games consisted only of creative video games such as <i>Minecraft</i>
and <i>LittleBigPlanet 1 - 3.</i> My first stints at programming were with <i>iWeb,</i> Apple's short-lived website
creation software. My knowledge of programming came from moments like this. My education came from tinkering, researching,
and fixing my own mistakes.
