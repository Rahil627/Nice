Hello, my name is Graham Misail. I am an everything developer (frontend, backend, game, app) that specializes
in web development. 

My motivation for development is often to streamline myself and help others. For instance, I developed
<i>Nice, </i> a simple static site generator to easily create static websites from text files.
