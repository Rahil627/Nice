title: Implementing Screen Shake using Trig

Screen shake is a popular effect used in video games where the visible contents on the 
screen will shake. To implement this effect, all you need is some basic trigonometry. 

<h5>Implementation</h5>

<p>
We want our screen to shake in all directions: up, down, left, and right. To achieve this,
we will use the <i>sin</i> trig ratio. If you are unfamiliar, <i>sin</i> will return a 
value within -1 and 1 based on the angle given (For a more detailed explanation, I'd recommend
researching the basic trig ratios: sin, cos, and tan.)
</p>

<p>
My implementation of screen shake will be in Haxe, but the logic will stay the same for most languages as long as they have a random number function and trig functions. By the way, <i>camera</i> represents a generic camera object with a position.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
public function shake(a : Float) {
    camera.x = a * Math.sin((2 * Math.PI) * Math.random());
    camera.y = a * Math.sin((2 * Math.PI) * Math.random());
}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
If you have learned about trig ratios, you should know that 'a,' or the amplitude, is the max
displacement in either direction. The amplitude will be the max number of pixels the camera will move in
any direction.
</p>

<p>
Since <i>Math.random()</i> returns a value from 0 to 1, we can find a random angle by multiplying our random number by
the period of <i>sin.</i> For example, if <i>Math.random</i> generates 0.25 and we multiply it by <i>2 * Math.PI</i>,
we will get the angle <i>Math.PI / 2</i> radians, or 90 degrees. <i>Math.sin(Math.PI / 2)</i> equals 1. If we multiply this
by our amplitude, we will get how far we will displace the camera. If the amplitude is 10, then we will be moving the camera
10 pixels in either the x or y directions. If the angle is greater than <i>Math.PI</i> then the camera will move in the negative
direction. 
</p>

<p>
To create the desired effect, call the <i>shake</i> function every frame you want the screen to shake.
