    Chess + Tic Tac Toe = Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. After playing this game countless times on napkins,
    homework assignments, and notebooks, I decided that it would be best to create a web version of the game for 
    myself. My implementation of the game uses Haxe, jQuery, HTML & CSS and is meant to be run on desktop computers.
