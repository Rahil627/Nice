title: EnglishScript, MIT Blueprint 18'

<p>
    The learning curve of programming is very difficult for many individuals. At this year's MIT Blueprint, 
    our group created a solution to this issue. The solution was <strong>EnglishScript</strong>. EnglishScript
    is an interpreted programming language which replicates the English language. The goal of this language
    was to abstract logic from syntax, allowing the user to learn how programming languages flow as opposed to a specific
    syntax.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
variable x equals 99 #you can define comments with number symbols
x equals 4

variable y equals 10
y equals 10 plus 4
x equals 4 times 4

call print The variable x is equal to @x
call print By the way, y is equal to @y
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    This code will output to:

    <pre>
        <code>
The variable x is equal to 16
By the way, y is equal to 14
        </code>
    </pre>

    The goal of the language was to allow novice programmers to learn programming <strong>logic</strong> instead of
    a specific syntax. With this knowledge, the difficulty of learning other languages would be greatly minimized.
</p>

<h5>Implementation</h5>
<p>
    EnglishScript was implemented in Javascript. The language itself, although running on the client side, is not dependent
    on the client or server side. The library requires a string that the interpreter will run. As long as you have a
    string, EnglishScript does not care where it is run.
</p>
<p>
    The interpreter takes a string and splits it by line breaks, or '\n' characters. For every line, the interpreter
    will split the line by spaces, or the " " character. It first looks for keywords such as "variable," "equals," and "call." 
    When it finds one of these phrases, it knows that it must be in a particular format. For instance, if it sees "equals", that
    must mean that the term before it will be set to the term after it. It looks the preceding term, sees if it is a variable, and sets
    it to the term after it.
