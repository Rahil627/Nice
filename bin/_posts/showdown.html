Showdown was a fighting game that I developed during middle school. The purpose of the game was to provide
some entertainment when we had access to computers during school. The game, implemented in Haxe and HaxeFlixel, went through a variety of 
structural changes during its development.

<h5>Design</h5>
<p>
    In the initial phase of development, new levels were created by creating a new class that inherited from a
    'Level' class. Although it seemed like a decent design choice at the time, I soon realized that nearly every
    level used the same logic and assets. Therefore, creating an entirely new class for levels would make the program
    bloated. In the next iteration of Showdown, these classes were replaced by JSON files. There was a single 'Level' class that
    required a JSON file. This class would then customize the base level using the JSON data that is passed to it.

<p>
    Characters fell into the same issue as levels; they shared way too much data to be separate classes. This was solved by
    following the JSON approach. Each character had a specific JSON file that would be passed to a base 'Character' class. This
    would customize the character using the JSON data. Aside from simplifying player creation, users were able to manipulate
    player data.
